Simple webserver using libevent
===

This is a simple (single-threaded) webserver making use of libevent. I wrote [an article about this project](http://www.maxbeutel.de/articles/05-Simple-Webserver-with-libevent-in-C++.html), describing the background of it.

Usage
---

After cloning this project, it needs cmake to build it.

```
cd libevent-webserver
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
./webserver
```
